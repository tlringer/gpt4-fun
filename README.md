This doesn't actually prove anything yet, it just tells a GPT-4-generated joke about a bored computer scientist prompting a language model to write proofs. Nonetheless, basic setup:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    pip install openai==v0.27.0
    python proofjoke.py

Where you replace the `...` with your GPT-4 key.
