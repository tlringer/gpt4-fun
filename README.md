This doesn't actually prove anything yet, it just tells a GPT-4-generated joke about a bored computer scientist prompting a language model to write proofs. Nonetheless, basic setup:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    pip install openai==v0.27.0
    python proofjoke.py

Where you replace the `...` with your GPT-4 key.

To use a really quickly written Coq proof bot with zero guarantees to do anything reasonable at all:

    python proof.py

Enjoy!

Please feel free to contribute if you add your own fun proof-related GPT-4 things here, or make this nicer or whatever.
